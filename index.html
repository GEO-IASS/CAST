<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introducing CAST 0.1 Alpha</h3>

<p>CAST is a free and open-source cross-platform program (Windows, Mac OSX and Linux) designed to detect spatial patterns and trends in Space-Time data. The idea is to
make it easy to represent different dimensions and contexts of Space-Time data (e.g. crime data) in views such as maps, graphs, and calendars that can be
animated over time.
Like it's predecessor software [GeoDa](http://geodacenter.github.io/), CAST provides a user-friendly and graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) on Space-Time data.
All of these views are linked to allow analysts to identify how selected
subsets of the data, such as particular beats, are characterized across these dimensions.
Using statistical significance tests, CAST includes several cluster maps and trend graphs to
detect where concentrations of crimes are higher or lower than expected.</p>

<p>
  The program runs on three operating systems: Windows, MacOSX and Linux (Figure 1).
It is designed as a user-friendly interface to [PySAL](http://pysal.github.io), the spatial analysis library developed at
the GeoDa Center in Python that serves as the code base for its functionality.

The interface of CAST is very similar to old version of GeoDa, but GeoDa is designed for the analysis of one area-level
dataset at a time while CAST can display multiple shapefiles simultaneously as layers in
one view and/or as separate views. Like GeoDa, CAST reads so-called shapefiles, the
geographic file format related to ESRI’s ArcGIS software, the most widely used commercial
Geographic Information System (GIS).

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
