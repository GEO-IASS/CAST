# CAST
A Python Software for Space-Time Analytics


## Introduction

`CAST` is a free and open-source cross-platform program (Windows, Mac OSX and Linux) designed "to detect spatial patterns and trends in Space-Time data." 

It is developed using Python (based on wxPython and PySAL) and C++ (to accelerate some core functionalities e.g. Kernal Density Map, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation aka LISA).

Like it's predecessor software [GeoDa](http://geodacenter.githu.io), CAST provides a user-friendly and graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) on Space-Time data.

The idea is to make it easy to represent different dimensions and contexts of Space-Time data (like crime types or neighborhood characteristics) â€“ in views such as maps, graphs, and calendars that can be animated over time. All of these views are linked to allow analysts to identify how selected subsets of the data, such as particular beats, are characterized across these dimensions. Using statistical significance tests, CAST includes several cluster maps and trend graphs to detect where concentrations of crimes are higher or lower than expected.
